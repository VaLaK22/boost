# SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2022

In 2022 the Beginner Boost returns to its roots as a part of the
SKILSTAK Learning Community curriculum fulfilling the Preparation and
most of the Programming stages enabling you to complete the Projects
stage and eventually become a Professional. This years Boost will also
serve as the basis for the following (free) books and videos (planned
tentatively for publishing along with the Boost in 2023):

* **Activate Your Autodidact, Learn Like the Best**
* **Conquer the Command Line, Become a Shell Native**
* **Just Enough Networking Knowledge**
* **Polyglot Programming: Learn to Code in Go, Python, and Javascript**

Before you begin, please make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
requirements â€” especially having already installed Docker Desktop onto a
computer on which you have admin permissions. We are hear to help if you
have questions about any of these requirements. Check the [FAQ](faq) for
answers to your questions or ask them in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/9wydZXY) server or live during Sunday [AMA
sessions](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule).
