# SKILSTAK Beginner Boost Series

## "What's a 'Beginner Boost'?"

These days the Boost is broken into three parts:

* 18 Weeks (May/4-Aug/27): Tech Tools, Practices, and Programming (I)
* 18 Weeks (Sep/3-Dec/31): Infrastructure Engineering (II)
* 10 Weeks (Jan/7-Apr/22): Containers and Kubernetes (III)

The first part focuses on upskilling a basic computer user into
a entry-level engineer proficient and terminal native with strong
command-line skills and basic programming ability. 

The second part focuses on the regular tasks asked of any professional
infrastructure engineer supporting an on-prem cloud of Linux servers.

The third part specifically focuses on the cloud-native approach to
infrastructure engineering and applications development. Note that the
focus is always on building *on-prem* infrastructure, not cloud
providers. Understanding cloud providers is easy after building and
maintaining your own cloud at home, plus it will get you a job faster if
you do.

Here's a sample of some specific topics:

* Use a Mac iTerm2 terminal with brew
* Use Windows terminal with Git Bash on Windows
* Setup Ubuntu Linux virtual machine with VirtualBox
* Use SSH to create terminal connections and tunnel
* Use containers (Docker) from terminal on Linux servers
* Set up basic networking for virtual machines and containers
* Script powerful "one-liner" commands with filters
* Code utilities in Bash and Go
* Manage and share knowledge and source code
* Connect with professional tech communities to seek opportunities

## "When are they?"

Sessions take place every Saturday 12:00-17:00 (New York time) with
"office hours" Sundays 12:00-15:00. Sometimes they will be moved or
cancelled depending on personal conflicts and holidays. Sometimes we'll
go slightly longer depending on the content. Check the
<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule> for when.

## "Five hours? Do you take breaks?"

* 12 minutes off
* 54 minutes on

Yes, we pretty strictly take a 12 minute break ever 54 minutes (which
happens to be the exact times required by Twitch to ensure we are not
interrupted with ad breaks by taking them intentionally instead).

## Before You Begin

Please make sure you have a computer with at least the following minimum
specs:

* Windows 10 or Mac x86
* 4 Core (x86)
* 8 GB Memory (RAM)
* 500 GB Drive (100 GB Free)

Also make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
[requirements](requirements) â€” especially installing VirtualBox onto a
computer on which you have admin permissions. We are hear to help if you
have questions about any of these requirements. Check the [FAQ](faq) for
answers to your questions or ask them in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/9wydZXY) server or live during Sunday [AMA
sessions](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule). Videos of sessions are
always saved to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) and posted to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwxrob).

## What changed since 2021?

* Focus on cloud-native infrastructure engineer and security jobs
* Increased duration to 18 weeks (5 weeks before)
* No longer daily, now 5-hours on Saturday (usually)
* Single, long-form video with full coverage of material
* Asking to repeat during week what was done to master
* More project based, even less theory
* More "hand holding" since we are "pairing" with beginners
* Multiple programming languages covered 
* More networking, but still just "How does Internet work?"
* Certain topics moved to Infrastructure Engineering Boost
* Focus on Linux Ubuntu server VM on local machine
* Lighter on containers (Docker) and no Kubernetes (moved to own Boost)
