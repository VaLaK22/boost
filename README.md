# SKILSTAK Beginner Boost Series

## What's a "Beginner Boost"?

These days the Boost is broken into three parts. The first part focuses
on upskilling a basic computer user into a entry-level engineer
proficient and terminal native with strong command-line skills and basic
programming ability. The second part focuses on the regular tasks asked
of any professional infrastructure engineer supporting an on-prem
cloud of Linux servers. The third part specifically focuses on the
cloud-native approach to infrastructure engineering and applications
development. Note that the focus is always on building *on-prem*
infrastructure, not cloud providers. Understanding cloud providers is
easy after building and maintaining your own cloud at home, plus it will
get you a job faster if you do.

To give you an idea, the first Boost focuses on the following:

* Using Windows WSL2 with Chocolatey
* Using Mac with Brew and GNU utils
* Using a Kali Linux GUI virtual machine
* Using several Ubuntu Linux server virtual machines
* Using SSH to create terminal connections and tunnel
* Using containers (Docker) from terminal on Linux servers
* Setting up basic networking for virtual machines and containers
* Configuring shell interfaces for Windows, Mac, UNIX, and Linux
* Scripting powerful "one-liner" commands with filters
* Coding utilities in Bash, Perl, Python, Ruby, PowerShell and Go
* Managing and sharing knowledge and source code
* Connecting with professional tech communities to seek opportunities

## When are they?

* 18 Weeks (May/4-Aug/27): Essential Tool, Practices, and Programming (I)
* 18 Weeks (Sep/3-Dec/31): Infrastructure Engineering (II)
* 10 Weeks (Jan/7-Apr/22): Containers and Kubernetes (III)
 
Sessions take place every Saturday 12:00-17:00 (New York time) with
"office hours" Sundays 12:00-15:00. Sometimes they will be moved or
cancelled depending on personal conflicts and holidays. Check the
<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule> for when.

Before you begin, please make sure you have a computer with at least the
following minimum specs:

* Windows 10 or Mac x86
* 4 Core (x86)
* 8 GB Memory (RAM)
* 500 GB Drive (100 GB Free)

Also make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
[requirements](requirements) — especially installing VirtualBox onto a
computer on which you have admin permissions. We are hear to help if you
have questions about any of these requirements. Check the [FAQ](faq) for
answers to your questions or ask them in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/9wydZXY) server or live during Sunday [AMA
sessions](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule). Videos of sessions are
always saved to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) and posted to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwxrob).

> ⏰ We start promptly 11 minutes and 11 seconds after every hour. ☺️

## What changed since 2021?

* Focus on cloud-native infrastructure engineer and security jobs
* Increased duration to 18 weeks (5 weeks before)
* No longer daily, now 5-hours on Saturday (usually)
* Single, long-form video with full coverage of material
* No homework required (but will have optional "side quests")
* More project based, even less theory
* More "hand holding" since we are "pairing" with beginners
* Multiple programming languages covered 
* More networking, but still just "How does Internet work?"
* Certain topics moved to Infrastructure Engineering Boost
* Focus on Windows WSL2, Mac terminal, Linux VMs (Kali, Rocky)
* Light on containers (Docker) and no Kubernetes (moved to own Boost)
